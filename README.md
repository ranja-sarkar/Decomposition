# PCA 
Typically in unsupervised learning, a minor percentage of datapoints are assumed as outliers. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) uses a cluster method to detect an anomaly, assumes
the inliers (normal datapoints) belong to large and dense clusters and the outliers/anomalies belong to either smaller and sparse clusters or none. The algorithm PCA determines what constitutes
a normal class. 

Considering time-series data (refer to csv file and notebook) and assuming 1% outliers in the dataset, here's the result of PCA (red points are anomalies).
